/*
The having clause

We use the having clause to filter data after group.
The difference between whera and having clauses. The first, where is used to filter before group
and having is used to filter after group. The second, the having clause can't refer to 
attribute that hasn't been selected. 


The order:
SELECT 
FROM
GROUP BY
HAVING

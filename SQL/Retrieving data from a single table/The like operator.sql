/*
The like operator

We use it to  search by string 

(WHERE "attribute" LIKE 'letter%') this code will show all the columns that the attribute begins 
with the letter.

Note that you can use letter% for beginning, %letter for end, %letter% if contains the letter,
use "_" to indicate how many characters and do a specific research "___letter"

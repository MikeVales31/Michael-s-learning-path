/*
Synchronizing a model with a database

You can go on the edit table option to delete, rename or update some data but only 
if you are the only working in the database.

The production enviroment is where our users access our applications or databases.
We should be able to duplicate those changes in other databases.

Go to the physical model, we made the changes in the model, then we go to database section,
and select "Synchronize model" leave the changes as default and accept.

/*
Primary keys (PK)

Is a column that uniquely identifies each record within a table, 
a composite primary key is the one that has multiple columns.

Ideally a primary key should not change.
By convention, we should always put the primary key first.

In the situations that we can't make a good primary key we add a column.

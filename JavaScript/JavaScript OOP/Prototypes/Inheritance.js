/**
 * Inheritance is one of the core concepts of OOP
 * that enables an object to take the properties and methods of another object.
 * 
 * The main class is called Base/Super/Parent class.
 * The others are Derived/Sub/Child.
 * 
 * In JavaScript there are only objects so we use prototypical inheritance.

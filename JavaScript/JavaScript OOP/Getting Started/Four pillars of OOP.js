/*
The four core concepts of OOP 
1)Encapsulation: combine a group of related variables and functions.
We refer at this variables => properties and functions => methods

2)Abstaction: hide the details and complexity and show only the essentials.
3)Inheritance: enable a new class to have the same properties and methods of an existing class.
4)Polymorphism: many forms or refactor.

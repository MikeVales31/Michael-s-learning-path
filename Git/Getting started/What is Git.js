/*
What is Git ??
Git is the most popular version control system.
A version control system can:
1) Track history
2) Work together

Version control systems can be:
Centralaized: All team members connect to a central server to get the latest version
of the code and to share changes. It could be a problem if the server goes offline.

Distributed: every team member has a copy of the proyect with the history in the machine,
so we can save locally the changes, so the server has a problem we can sincronize with 
others. (Git and Mercurial)

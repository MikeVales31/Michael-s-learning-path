/*
Collaboration workflow

In github we select a repository, in the branches and create a new branch

then we go to our local repository and do (git fetch)
The other persons have to clone the repository and make changes into the branch created.
Then we have to merge in the master branch

(git remote prune origin) to remove the tracked branches that are not under origin.

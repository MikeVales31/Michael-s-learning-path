/*
Resolving conflicts

If you have problems merging or closing a pull request.
Even when you have conflicts you can create a pull request.
It can be resolved in github or git, if you do it on git the person who does the push 
and makes the conflict will need to check it.

In github we go to the pull request, select resolve conflict, in the page will show you the conflicts,
and you need to resolve, then mark as resolve and commit merge.

Then we merge the pull request.

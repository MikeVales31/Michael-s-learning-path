/*
Fast-forward merges

(git log --oneline  --all --graph) show all the commits and branches.
(git merge "name of the branch") Merge to the current branch.
(git merge --no-ff "name of the brach") Merge without fast-forward.

The pros of no ff merge commits 
True reflection of history.
Allow reverting a feature.

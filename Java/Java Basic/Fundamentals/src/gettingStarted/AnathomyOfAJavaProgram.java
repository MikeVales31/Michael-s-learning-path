/*
Anathomy of a Java program

The smallest building block are functions. 
function: a block of code that performs a task.

We start by specifying the return type of a function.
Number, dateTime, void,...

Then the name of the function and parameters

class: a container for related functions.

We start with 'class' keyword followed by the name.

Method: a function that is part of a class.

Access modifiers like public or private, most of the time we use a 
public access modifier.

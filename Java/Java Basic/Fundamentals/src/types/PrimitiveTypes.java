/*
Primitive types

for storing simple values.

byte [-128, 127]
short [-32k, 32k]
int [-2B, 2B]
long
float
double 
char
boolean

Example:

byte age = 30;
long viewsCount = 3_123_456_789L;
float price = 10.99F;
char letter = 'A';
boolean isEligible = false;

Note: by default the compiler sees like integers the numbers so put and L at the end, the same
can be said to the decimal sees like a double so you have to sufix with an F.

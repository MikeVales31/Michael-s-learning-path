/*
The supplier interface

Represents  an operation that takes no inputs and returns a value ("supplies a value").

Note: method get is lazy evaluation (need to explicity call).
Note: "Primitive" Supplier specialization for primitives.

Example:

        Supplier<"Primitive type"> name = () -> return
        System.out.println(name.get());

/*
Lambda expressions 

Anonymous function that we can pass around.

Note: you have to use the following steps.

1) In a method that has been declared, when you call it (interface method),
   you don't have to pass the type.

2) Use the lambda operator " -> " to tell what is going to do.

Example:

        public static void show(){

            " inteface method "((" name of the parameters ") -> {
            
                "implementation"

            });
        }

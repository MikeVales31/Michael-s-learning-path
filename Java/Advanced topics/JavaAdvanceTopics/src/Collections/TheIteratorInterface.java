/*
The iterator interface

The iterator method of the iterable interable interface is actually another interface.

1) Create a private class that implemenets the iterator

Note: have 2 methods hasNext() and next().

2) Create a constructor with the generic parameter and a field with the same name.
3) Override the hasNext() method to return a # or expression that makes the length 
4) Override the next() method to return the items.

Note: the iterator method should return an object (this)

    return "object"(this)

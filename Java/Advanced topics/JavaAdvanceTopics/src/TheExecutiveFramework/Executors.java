/*
Executors

Note: the subinterface ExecutorService

1) Create thread pool implementation.

2) Schedule tasks to run after a delay or periodically.

3) Pool that recursively split a task into smaller tasks and combine the result of each
   sub task to produce an overall result.


   Example: 

        Executors.newFixedThreadPool(#)

Note: Use the executors class and check the methods.
Note: it simplify thread manipulation but do not solve the problems.

/*
Combining completable futures 


Start two tasks asynchronously and then combine the result.

1) Create a CompletableFuture.supplyAsync( "task" )            
         Note: repeat this # of tasks you want to combine and store each one in a variable.

2) Call the variable and use thenCombine( "operation with tasks") method.

/*
Constraints (restrictions)

Note: in the declaration of the generic class in the parameter use the "extends" keyword
      followed by the class or interface. You can add multiple classes or intefaces using "&".

Note: it is like casting.

Example:

    public class GenericList <T extends Number>{
    
    }

Note: we said that "T" is bounded.

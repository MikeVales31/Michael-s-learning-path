/*
Overriding methods

When you inherit a method from the base class and change the implementation.

When can override any method you inherit doesnot matter if it is from a parent or 
grandparent 

An annotation is a label that we attach to a class member.

Example:

@Override 
public String toString(){
return text;
}
*/
package Inheritance;

public class OverridingMethods {
    
}

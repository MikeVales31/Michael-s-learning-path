/*
Abstact classes and methods

We use abstract classes when you create a class but you are not able to instance.

you can create as abstract.
Example:

public abstract class UIControl{
    private boolean isEnable = true;

    public void render(){
    }
}
*/

package Inheritance;

public class AbstractClassesAndMethods {
    
}

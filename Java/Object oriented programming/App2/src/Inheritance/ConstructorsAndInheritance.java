/*
Constructors and inheritance

A constructor is called when you create an instance of a class.

First we add the fields, then we add the constructor and finally we add
all the methods.

We use the "super" keyword followed by parethesis to call the constructor 
of the base class, this should be the very first statement.


Example:
public textBox(){
super();
System.out.println("textBox");
}

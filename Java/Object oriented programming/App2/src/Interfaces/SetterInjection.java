/*
Setter injection

We can change the dependencies throughout the lifetime of our program.

Note: remember when you implement it need to have the methods.

Example:

public void setCalculator(TaxCalculator calculator){
        this.calculator = calculator;
}
*/

package Interfaces;

public class SetterInjection {
    
}

/* 
Construnctors

Is a special method that is called when we create a new object.

Example:

public Employee(int baseSalary, int hourlyRate){
    setBaseSalary(baseSalary);
    setHourlyRate(hourlyRate);
}

Note: now the construnctor expects 2 arguments when you call it, 
if you don't create a construnctor java automatically will do it 
with the default values.

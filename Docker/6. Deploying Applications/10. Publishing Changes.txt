Publishing Changes

Note: you should properly tag your images before deploying to various enviroments, so you can know the version.
      if you find inconsistency like the applications behaves differently in the staging enviroment with the production,
      we do not know what is the version of the enviroment are running.

We add the image property in the web service and API service                    example: (image: vidly_web:1) 
                                                                                         (image: vidly_api:1)

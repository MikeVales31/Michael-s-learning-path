Reducing the Image Size 

1. Create an optimized asset for production
2. Put the assets inside of the web server and serve them
3. Go to the docker file and copy it and rename the copy
4. You can rename the FROM command with AS and give a name                      example: (FROM node:14.16.0-alpine3.13 AS build-stage)
                                                                                Note: to make commentaries use (#)
5. Create another FROM command and use the webserver (nginx. apache, ...)
6. Create a copy of the files of the previous FROM (build stage)

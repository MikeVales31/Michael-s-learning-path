Defining the Production Configuration

1. Create a copy of the docker-compose file with other name                             example: docker-compose.prod.yml
2. Create a property called restart in each service and assign no                       example: (restart: no)

IMPORTANT 
you can see every property in (docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)

Deploying the Application 

1. docker-machine ls
2. docker-machine env (name of machine)

Note: if you put $() it will execute first the things inside the parenthesis, then will aplly it as an argument of the other command.
Note: take the last command of the (docker-machine env (name of machine)) that returns (eval...) and run it, 
      then any commands we run after will be sent to the docker engine on the machine 

Command

docker-compose -f (docker-compose [file for production]) up -d

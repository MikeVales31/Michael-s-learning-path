Setting the User

By default Docker took the root user that has the highest privileges.

Commands

ducker run -it (alpine)
addgroup (name)
adduser -S -G (primary group) (name of the user)      Note: Whenever you create a user make a group with the same name
groups app 

Note: in visual studio on a Dockerfile make the commands and save the changes.
Note: use the build command on the terminal.

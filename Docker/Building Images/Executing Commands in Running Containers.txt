Executing Commands in Running Containers

When you start a container it executes the default command that we specified in our Docker file.

Note: to execute on a running container later.


Commands 

docker exec (container) (any command [windows or Linux])             execute anything
docker exec -it (container) sh                                       shell sesion inside of a container         Note: when we are done type (exit)
 




Note: the difference between (exec) and (run). With (run) we start a new container and run a command. With (exec) we execute a command 
in a running container

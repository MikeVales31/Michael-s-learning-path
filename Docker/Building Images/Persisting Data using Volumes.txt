Persisting Data using Volumes 

Volumes: storage outide of containers, it can be a directory on the host or somewhere in the cloud.


Commands

docker volume create (volume name)                                       Create a new volume 
docker volume inspect (volume name)                                      Note: Driver is a dirctory on the host 
                                                                               Mountpoint directory location 

docker run -d -p 4000:3000 -v (volume name):(absolute path) (image)            Note: in the absolute path it has to be in the file system 
                                                                               of the container

docker exec -it (container) sh 

Note: when you create the data directory checkout who has the permissions to do things.
Note: in the Dockerfile use the (WORKDIR) and then (RUN) mkdir.
Note: reubuild the image.
Note: go to the directory and create the data (files or anything).

Note: in volumes if you delete the container, the file will keep existing. Because the directory is stored outside of the container.


IMPORTANT

Volumes are the right way to persist data in Docker as applications because they have different life cycles from containers.
We can share a volume amongst multiple containers.

Speeding Up Builds

1. When it build the image, it takes a collection of layers.
2. it will create a new layer creating a group and a user.
3. ...

Note: for each instruction it will create a layer.

Note: Docker has an optimization mechanism built into it. The next time we ask Docker to build this image it is going to look at the instruction
      and see if it has changed, if it hasn't it will reuse it from its cache. And make this line by line.

IMPORTANT
To optimize the builds you should organize your Docker file such that the instructions that don't change frequently should be on the top
and the instructions or files that change frequently should be down.

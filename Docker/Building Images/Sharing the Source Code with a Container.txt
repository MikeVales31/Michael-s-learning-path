Sharing the Source Code with a Container 

Publishing changes

For production: build a new image
For development 

Note: we can create a mapping or a binding between a directory on the host and a directory inside the container.
      So this way any changes we make to any files in this directory are immediately visible inside the container.

Commands 

docker run -d -p 5001:3000 -v $(pwd):app/data (image)             Note: pwd is print working directory without $() docker will think is a name volume
                                                                  Note: when we execute the complete command $(pwd) will be evaluated first

Defining Entrypoints

Note: in the project directory

Command 

ducker run (image name) npm start



ORDER OF COMMANDS 

FROM 
RUN 
USER 
WORKDIR 
COPY 
RUN     
ENV
EXPOSE 
CMD                                                Note: CMD for command instructions, you can't have multiple command instructions
ENTRYPOINT                                         

Note: in the terminal use the following command "docker build -t (app name) ."
Note: the RUN instruction is a build time instruction (building the image). CMD instruction is for a runtime instruction.(when start a container).
Note: CMD has a Shell form               example: CMD npm start                Note: ducker will execute the command inside of a separate shell
                Execute form             example: CMD ["npm", "start"]         Note: try to always use the execute form

Note: ENTRYPOINT has a shell form and execute form too, the difference is we can rewrite a command starting a container on CMD and it is a little 
      more difficult on ENTRYPOINT. Are really similar CMD and ENTRYPOINT.

Docker Networking

When we run an application with docker compose it will automatically create a Network and add containers on that Network.

Commands

docker network ls                              see all the networks in the machine


Note: every Docker installation has three networks (bridge, host, none)
Note: start a shell session in the web container and ping the other container

docker exec -it (container ID) sh 
    ping (container name)
    ifconfig                                          see the IP adress of the container                                        

Note: docker comes with an embedded DNS server that contains the name and IP of these containers, inside each container we have a component
      called the DNS resolver. This DNS resolver talks to the DNS server to find the IP address of the target container. So when we ping the 
      other container the DNS resolver asks the server what is the IP adress of the container and the server returns the adress then the container
      call it using the IP adress. Each container has an api adress of the network.

Note: open (mongodb compass) to verify it.

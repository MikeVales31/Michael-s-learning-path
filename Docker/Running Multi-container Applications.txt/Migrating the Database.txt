Migrating the Database

When you release the application, we want the database in a particular shape with some data.


Database Migration tool (migrate mongo)

Using this we can create database migration scripts.

Commands

migrate-mongo up 


Note: for executing the database migration as part of starting our application.
1. Go to the docker file in the backend
2. Call the CMD in this example ["npm", "start"]
3. Go to the compose-file and add below volumes (command: ./wait-for db:27017 && migrate-mongo up && npm start)

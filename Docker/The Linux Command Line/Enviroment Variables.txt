docker ps                                      see processors or containers
docker ps -a                                   see all containers (including stop)
docker start -i (container ID)                 start a container                                     Note: -i is so we can interact
source (file)                                  reload a file                                         exmple: source .bashrc
                                                                                                     Note: we have to execute it on the 
                                                                                                           home directory so we add ~/
                                                                                                            (source ~/ .bashrc)


Note: bashrc is the user's personal startup file.
Note: you can redirection into another file but careful if you just run the command it will be overwrite. So in order to append(>>)
      instead of just one. IMPORTANT the changes made it, are only effective in the next terminal session.

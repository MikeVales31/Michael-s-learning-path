Chaining or combine comands 

Just add a semicolumn at the end of each command.

Note: if you run multiple times and one command throws an error, the others keep executing.
Note: if we want to treat it like a transaction use the AND operator (&&).


Boolean
AND (&&)
OR  (||)


Note: we can use pipes to take the output of a command and send it to another command.
            Example: ls /bin | less                 Explanation: what comes out of the 1st command goes into the 2nd command.

Note: when you have a lot of commands, you can make more readable after you make your command put (\ + Enter) and do the next command.
      keep the semicolumn.

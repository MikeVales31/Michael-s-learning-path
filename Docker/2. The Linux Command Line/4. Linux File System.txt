Linux File System


Note: in Linux just like windows are files and directories organized in a tree (hierarchical constructor).

Windows (program) 

c:\\
        Program files
        Windows

Linux (program)
/
    bin (binaries or programs)                      root (home directory of the root user)
    boot (all the files related to booting)         lib (keeping library files)
    dev (devices)                                   var (variable)
    etc (editable text configuration)               proc (include files that represents running processes)
    home (store home directories / users )

Note: in Linux everything is a file including devices, directories, network socket, pipes and so on.

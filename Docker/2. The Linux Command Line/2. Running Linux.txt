Running Linux

Note: we can extract files from hub.docker.com

Commands:

docker pull 
docker run (if you have locally it will start a container otherwise it will search for it and then start a container).
docker ps (see the list of running containers/processes )
docker ps -a (see all the containers even if they stop)
ducker run -it "image" (start a container with the interact mode)
Note: this will return a shell prompt, a shell is a program that takes our commands and passes them to the operating system for execution.
Note: in the shell prompt the first part represents the currently log in user, after the @ we have the name of the machine,
      after the column where are we in the file system and the final symbol are the privileges.

Exmple:
root@2f759r6996e9: /#

Note: in the shell created, we can make the following commands-

echo (message) prints the message on the therminal.
whoami  shows the current user
echo $0  location of the shell program.
history  shows all commands executed lately 
Note: after history command you can put an (!) and the number that shows in the previous commands to replay it. 


Note: Bash means Bourne again shell. Steve Bourne create this programs.
Note: Linux is a case sensitive lenguage.

Creating a Compose File 

1. Create a new compose file (docker-compose.yml)             Note: if you already have 1 change it the name to (_[name]) and create a new one
2. Inside the yml file make the next commands

Commands

version: "3.8"                               Note: the last version
services:                                    Note: each service should have its own dockerfile
    web: 
        build: ./frontend                    Note: you can use any property of docker instead the build property
        ports: 
            - 3000:3000                      Note: the first is port of the host, the other is port 3000 of the container
    api:
        build: ./backend
        ports: 
            - 3001:3001
        enviroments:
            DB_URL: mongodb://db/vidly      Note: you need to type a mongoDB connection string, you can also sepcify the database name
    db:
        image: mongo:4.0-xenial
        ports: 
            -27017:27017                    Note: mongodb by default listens on port 27017
        volumes: 
            - vidly:/data/db                Note: in this case vidly is the name of the application too

volumes:                                    Note: this is the syntax we have to follow 
  vidly:                                    


Note: the most used properties are (build, image, ports, volumes, enviroment, ...)

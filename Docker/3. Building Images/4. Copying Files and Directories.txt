Copying Files and Directories

After using the FROM command, use the COPY command.

Note: when we execute the build command the last argument tells from where is accessible, and Docker client sends the content of this 
      directory to Docker engine this is called the build context.



Example:

    FROM node:14.16.0-alpine3.13
    COPY package.json README.md /app/                      

    Note: that in the copy command we can add multiple files (package.json, README.md) and you can make it also by patterns. 
          /app/ is the directory.
    
    Note: you can also use a relative path if we set the working directory first.

    FROM node:14.16.0-alpine3.13
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . . 

    Note: you can also use a this format  COPY["(file name with extension)", "working directory"] 


The ADD command has exactly the same syntax of copy, but it has 2 additional features.

1. We can add a file from a URL.
2. If you pass a compress file add will automatically uncompress this into a directory.


FINAL STEPS
1. In the terminal we have to build the image.
2. Start a container with the image

Setting the User

By default Docker took the root user that has the highest privileges.

Commands

ducker run -it (alpine)
addgroup (name)
adduser -S -G (primary group) (name of the user)      Note: Whenever you create a user make a group with the same name
groups app 


Note: in visual studio on a Dockerfile make the commands and save the changes.
      example:
                FROM node:14.16.0-alpine3.13
                WORKDIR /app
                COPY . .
                RUN npm install
                ENV API_URL=http://api.myapp.com
                EXPOSE 3000
                RUN addgroup app && adduser -S -G app app
                USER app



Note: use the build command on the terminal.

Setting Environment Variables

After the RUN command. Use the ENV command.

ENV (variable)=(assignation)

Example:

FROM 
WORKDIR
COPY
RUN
ENV API_URL=http://api.myapp.com/ 

Note: in a container we use (printenv) for inspecting environment variables, we can also (printenv)(variable) so it returns the value.
      Another option is (echo $(variable)) and it return the value.

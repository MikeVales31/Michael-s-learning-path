What is docker 

A platform for building, running and shipping applications in a consistent way. We can easily package our applications with everything it needs,
and run it anywhere on any machine with Docker.


Why your apps run in your local machine but does not somewhere else?
1. One or more files are missing 
2. Software version mismatch
3. Different configuration settings


Note: in new machines you do not have to install and configure all, just tell docker to bring the application and it will automatically do it


How to bring a docker application?
$ docker-compose up 

Note: it will automatically download and run everything it needs inside an isolation enviroment called container
Note: the container allows multiple applications use different versions of some software side by side.
Note: when we are done with the application, we can remove everything in one go ( $ docker-compose down --rmi all)

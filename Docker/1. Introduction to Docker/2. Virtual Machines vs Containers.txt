Virtual Machines vs Containers

Container 
1. Isolated enviroment for running an application like the Virtual Machine. 
2. Lightweight.
3. Use operator system (OS) of the host. (The kernel of the host)
4. Start quickly.
5. Need less hardware resources.

Note: kernel is the core of an operating system (manages applications and hardware resources).

Virtual Machine 
1. An abstraction of a machine (physical hardware), isolated enviroment.
2. Each one need a full copy of an operating system that needs to be licence patched and monitored.
3. Slow to start.
4. Resource intensive.


Hypervisor (VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper -v)
Tool that allow us to run several virtual machines in our physical machine.

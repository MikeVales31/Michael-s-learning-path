Development workflow

We take an application and dockerize it. 

Note: Dockerize it means make a small change so that it can be run by Docker. (add a docker file).

1. Docker files are plain text files that includes instructions to package up this applications into an image.
Note: the image contains a cut down OS, runtime enviroment, application files, third party libraries, enviroment variables ...

2. Tell docker to start a container using that image.
Note: containers are special process, because it has its own file system which is provided by the image. App get loaded inside a container or a process
      and this is how we run locally.

Note: Once we have the image we can push it to a registry (Docker hub) we can pull it from any machines running Docker.

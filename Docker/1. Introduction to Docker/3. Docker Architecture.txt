It uses a client - server(Docker engine) architecture 
1. The client component talks the serve component throw a REST API
2. The server sits in the background and takes care of building and running Docker containers

Note: Windows can run Windows and Linux containers, Linux just Linux containers, Mac uses a Linux Virtual Machine to run Linux containers.
